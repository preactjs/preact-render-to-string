## 6.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`926827c`](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-render-to-string/commit/926827c0745889545a97774535e778da3c808dd0) Thanks [@marvinhagemeister](https://github.com/marvinhagemeister)! - Add support for precompiled JSX transform, see https://deno.com/blog/v1.38#fastest-jsx-transform. Compared to traditional JSX transforms, the precompiled JSX transform tries to pre-serialize as much of the JSX as possible. That way less objects need to be created and serialized which relieves a lot of GC pressure.

  ```jsx
  // input
  <div class="foo">hello</div>;

  // output
  const tpl = [`<div class="foo">hello</div>`];
  jsxTemplate(tpl);
  ```
